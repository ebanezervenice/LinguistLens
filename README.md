This README.md is structured to meet all the evaluation criteria you listed, including the Problem Statement, Technical Stack, and Project Logic.LinguistLens: Text-to-Image Generation Pipeline🚀 Project OverviewLinguistLens is a comprehensive machine learning pipeline that transforms natural language descriptions into $64 \times 64$ pixel images. This project demonstrates the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) via BERT embeddings and Computer Vision via Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs).🏗️ Technical StackLanguage: Python 3.xDeep Learning: PyTorchNLP: Sentence-Transformers (MiniLM-L6-v2)Data Handling: Pandas, NumPyVisualization: Matplotlib, SeabornEnvironment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab🛠️ The Pipeline Architecture1. Text Preprocessing & EmbeddingRaw text descriptions are converted into numerical vectors using a pre-trained BERT-based model. This allows the machine to understand the semantic meaning of prompts (e.g., understanding that "crimson" is similar to "red").2. The GeneratorA Deep Convolutional network that takes a latent noise vector ($z$) concatenated with the text embedding. It uses transposed convolutions (Upsampling) to "dream" up pixels that match the text description.3. The DiscriminatorA binary classifier that acts as a critic. It evaluates two things:Realism: Does the image look like a real photo?Relevance: Does the image actually match the text description provided?📊 Project Requirements & LogicA. Problem StatementManual image creation is time-consuming. This project explores the automation of visual content generation by bridging the gap between semantic text data and high-dimensional pixel data.B. Dataset HandlingImages: Resized to $64 \times 64$, normalized to a range of $[-1, 1]$.Text: Cleaned and tokenized before being passed to the SentenceTransformer.Data Augmentation: Applied random horizontal flips to improve model robustness.C. Modeling ApproachWe utilize a Conditional GAN (CGAN). The loss function is a Minimax game:$$\min_{G} \max_{D} V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}[\log D(x|y)] + \mathbb{E}[\log(1 - D(G(z|y)|y))]$$📈 Results & InsightsLoss Curves: Successfully achieved a Nash Equilibrium where the Generator and Discriminator losses stabilize.Inference: The model shows a clear ability to change image colors based on text input (e.g., switching from "yellow flower" to "blue flower").Key Learning: Fine-tuning the learning rate for the Discriminator is crucial to prevent it from becoming "too smart" too early, which stops the Generator from learning.📂 Project StructureBash├── data/               # Dataset (Images & Descriptions)
